                <h3>Plan out the trip accordingly</h3>
                <p>
                    When going to one of these destionations, I strongly recommend planning out what you're going to do each day.
                    Look up each place you want to go to, and how to get there.
                    The last thing you want while traveling is extra stress as something goes wrong.

                <h3>Make sure to take care of yourself</h3>
                <p>
                    When traveling, you are going to get tired and exhausted quite fast.
                    So it's important that you are taking care of yourself. Making sure you get enough sleep,
                    that you eat enough food (especially healthy food), is vital.

                <h3>Bring extra clothes/shoes</h3>
                <p>
                    You never know if you're going to need extras of anything, especially underwear and socks.
                    The weather is quite unpredictable, and your stuff can get damaged cause of it.
                    Whether from rain, or other types of weather, it's good to have extras of clothes and shoes.
