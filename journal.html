            <h2>My First Day in France</h2>
            <cite>07/14/22 12:00 PM</cite>
            <p>
                We just got to the airbnb we're staying at, and I am exhausted. 
                After a 7 hour plane ride, where I got sick, we had to get driven to the place.
                The road was pretty bumpy, but we saw some interesting buildings.
                The place itself is beautiful, with a big pool, and some adorable cats.
                My favorite is an orange and white tabby named Cabbage Cabbage.

            <h2>Seeing the Cathedral of Chartres</h2>
            <cite>07/18/22 11:00 AM</cite>
            <p>
                My aunt drove my family and I to go see the Cathedral of Chartres.
                It was a long drive, and we stopped at a small restaurant for lunch.
                Afterwards we went to the Cathedral, and it was massive, with beautiful stained glass windows,
                and a ton of people.

            <h2>Visiting the Eiffel Tower</h2>
            <cite>07/20/22 3:00 PM</cite>
            <p>
                While we were staying in Paris, we went to go see the Eiffel Tower.
                The first thing to mention is that it is ginormous. There was a ton of people there,
                and we had to wait on line for quite a bit. We then took the elevator, which goes up the side and not straight up.
                Near the top of the tower we toured the little cafe area and took pictures.
